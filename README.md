# 📊 Research on the Trading Value of Chinese GVIX 🌐

## 📖 Abstract
This paper introduces a novel approach to constructing a generalized volatility index (GVIX) for the Chinese market, diverging from the geometric Brownian motion assumption underlying the traditional VIX index. The study investigates the properties of GVIX in the Chinese market, drawing on existing literature. It concludes with a comparison of GVIX against other volatility indices by assessing the performance of option trading strategies utilizing each index as the implied volatility input. The findings indicate that GVIX-based strategies achieve the highest annualized returns of 47.62% and a competitive Sharpe ratio of 1.94, suggesting that GVIX provides effective volatility information for option pricing.
